Safefile:
- static class with lots of members that gets updated by Game actors
  (last_pos, hp, inventory, last_character)

- make a dotfile and encrypt the contents 
- encryption key gets stored in the exe (gets generated upon first startup) (xd: embedding utility)

Ressource Files:
- embedd via xd : extended load and dump utility



TODO: 
- read xd docs and figure out how to load files into binary arrays
- add a way to parse files as binary input stream to images and textures
  do the same with sound if possible

- SafeState could then also be to be embedded but that would make updating really difficult, 
  by just adding a button to get load another Safefile from a previous install, 
  add warning to not paste new install over the old one

- decide on a file structure for install directory and pathing \\\\!



Updates:
external script or exe that pulls a new version from github or itch
new version will be prebuilt on github

Engine for building maps:
  Camera that accounts for the gameObjects i.e. scale, Position of newly placed objects (start at a scale of texture 1:1, 476:476),

  Maybe just render everything and don't worry about overdrawing in the engine?
  Figure out the file format for saving a scene
