Hackmen failed to converse for like 2 minutes straight

Greg got muted due to hackmen hearing himself trough his mic

Hackmen then summarised the story in the google doc

Short talk about selling our souls

Hackmen started yapping about tiddies and ass-cheeks

talk about map-design:
- Islands/Biomes with different themes corresponding to the bosses
- a few levels per Biome
  - first levels introduce new mechanic 
  - later levels allow the player to make use of those mechanics
- Overview (whole)map jumping into smaller view of the Stage by clicking on it


talk about other characters
- for now no multiple playable characters, but maybe in the future
  (i can already smell the refactor of the entire game for)
- vtuber friends appear as npcs, not bosses

Story Elements that won't get changed:
- Araa as main antagonist
- Gomi is boy
- Gomi is gone for some time 
- kevin summons araa 
- gomi gets cut off a lot
